	<h1>About Our Sanitation Standards</h1><br/>
	<p>Whole Foods Market always goes above and beyond with our quality standards.  The same goes for our disinfection practices! California law states that each implement/foot bath must be sanitized with an E.P.A registered disinfectant after each client.  Our standards take it to the next level, with hospital grade steam sterilization daily. After each client our specialists' safety.  Our foot bath disinfection routine includes a log to ensure that we are creating a safe salon environment that stays true to our quality standards!
