	<h1 id="about_the_salon">Welcome to The Salon at Whole Body!</h1>
	
	<p>Our salon is a committed green facility. For the health of our guests and our team members, we have made our salon an acetone- and carcinogen-free environment. To best enjoy our treatments, we ask that you remove conventional polishes, base/top coats, gels and acrylics prior to arriving for your appointments. When booking appointments, please mention all desired services and enhancements.  The more we know ahead of time, the more time we can spend pampering you!</p>
	<p>The salon hours of operation are 9:00am to 8:00pm, and the last appointment is at 7:00pm.</p>
	
	<p>Reception Hours: 9:00am-5:30pm</p>
	
	<p>For your convenience, our phone number is (408) 915-7936.</p>
	<p>Please call for Manicure/Pedicure Combinations</p>
	
	<p>If you arrive more than 15 minutes after your appointment time, we will need to reschedule.
