<h1>Appointments</h1><br/>
<p>"Please note that if you are booking a Mani/pedi combo services with two nail techs at the same time 
(including the premium mani/pedi) should call in to book. If you book a manicure and pedicure together on the website, they will be scheduled an hour apart (back to back).  Additionally, If you are booking services for two people at the same time, it is best to create log-ins for both people and book them separately. If you book two appointments under one log-in name, it will book the appointments an hour apart."</p>
